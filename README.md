## Disclaimer
Marker was created to play with [meteorjs](https://github.com/meteor/meteor). It uses [Shwodown](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown) for the markdown conversion, and [Backbone](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone) for the Router.

The app is deployed on [marker.meteor.com](http://marker.meteor.com/).
