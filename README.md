#A brave new era of wiki

Marker's fundamental principle is that setting up a wiki **should be as easy as typing an email**.

## Source

Feel free to browse the source code on [github](https://github.com/jtblin/marker).
Marker was developed as a side project to play with [meteorjs](https://github.com/meteor/meteor) awesome framework,
and provide a new, simple collaboration wiki experience.

## Demo

You can access the demo and create wikis on [http://marker.meteor.com/](http://marker.meteor.com/).

## Roadmap

The [roadmap](http://marker.meteor.com/Roadmap) is also hosted on the wiki.
